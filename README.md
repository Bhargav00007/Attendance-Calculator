The link to reach the website is https://bhargav00007.github.io/Attendance-Calculator/


# Logic behind the project:
The program takes three inputs from the user:
1) input1 = Current %
2) input2 = days conducted
3) input3 = Goal %

With the help of input1 & input2 we can bring the no. of days attend by the user
and with the goal percentage we can bring the total no. of days
Now by subtracting the current days from the goal days will bring the value we need more to reach the goal!

Here i have taken goal days as 133, since most of the colleges semester has an average of 133 days init.
